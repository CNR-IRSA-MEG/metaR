# ANTA_bdello Files description

The project compares metrics of genetic diversity from 2244 COI sequences between Antarctic and
non-Antarctic bdelloid species.
Two dataset were used: the main one had nine well-sampled species
and the secondary one had 14 species with less than 50 COI sequences each.
The file "DATA for ANALYSES 20200610.csv" is the dataset used for the main analyses and the main
plots, with R script reported in "anta analyses.R".
The file "minor dataset.csv" is the dataset used for the secondary,
additional analyses and the relative plots, with R script reported in "minor dataset analyses.R".
