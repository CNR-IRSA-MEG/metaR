non-Antarctic bdelloid species.

- The file "HAPLO whole.phy" is the alignment at the haplotype level to obtain the phylogenetic tree in "HAPLO whole BEAST.tree".
- The file "anda data.csv" is the dataset used for the statistical analyses and to obtain the plots, with R script reported in "anta analyses.R".
